# Level Rules
Sometimes there will be a treasure chest filled with armors, weapons, or guns if you paid for them.  Also sometimes when you kill a minion that has a hood and can do spells its hood will drop and you will have the ability to wear it and do the same spells as what the minion could do.  Depending on the color of the hood the spell will be different.  Also sometimes the minions can drop a ninja star and if you pick it up you can turn into a ninja Blob for 10 seconds.  When you turn into a ninja Blob you can throw infinty ninja stars, climb walls, wall jump, and use a super long ninja sword.  Plus minions can rarely drop an energy suit.  If you collect the energy suit you can wear if and it gives you powers such as running really fast and be able to use an special gun that shoots lasers.
